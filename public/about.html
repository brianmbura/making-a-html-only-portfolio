<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Brian Mbura, a passionate and self-driven creative and tech professional based in Kenya. I specialize in video editing, photography, videography, graphic design, and full-stack web development. I’m also an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Communication and Technology.</p>

<p>My creative journey began back in high school, capturing moments on a Samsung tablet. In 2017, I got my first digital camera a Canon XUXII which marked the beginning of my professional path. After completing KCSE in 2018, I began pursuing photography more seriously and co-founded <b>Hatupoi Production</b> with my cousin, <b>Prince Edy Tz</b>. Since 2020, we’ve turned our passion into a business, telling visual stories that resonate.</p>

<p>Alongside media production, I have built a strong foundation in software development—working on real-world projects like <b>Online Car Rental Systems</b>. My recent AWS certification and background in Linux, Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and MySQL have equipped me to handle cloud-based solutions and DevOps workflows with confidence.</p>

<p>I enjoy bringing ideas to life whether it’s through editing cinematic wedding teasers, building responsive apps, or creating brand identities. I’m also exploring animation, VFX, and faceless YouTube content to expand my creative reach.</p>

<p>If you're looking for someone who blends creativity with technical expertise. Let’s collaborate and bring your ideas to life visually and digitally.</p>
